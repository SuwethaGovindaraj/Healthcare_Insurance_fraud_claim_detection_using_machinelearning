# Healthcare_Insurance_fraud_claim_detection_using_machinelearning

ABSTRACT
Healthcare insurance fraud poses a significant challenge to the industry, leading to substantial financial losses and compromised patient care. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to detect healthcare insurance claim fraud using advanced machine learning techniques, with a focus on visualizing the results through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The study begins with data collection and pre-processing, where historical insurance claim data is curated and cleaned for analysis. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to the pre-processed data to develop robust fraud detection models. These models leverage features such as claimant demographics, medical procedures, billing codes, and historical claim patterns to identify suspicious claims. The predictive models are assessed for its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant metrics to ensure its effectiveness in fraud detection. Furthermore, feature importance analysis helps in understanding which variables contribute most to fraud detection, aiding in the development of actionable insights for fraud prevention. To make the results accessible and actionable for healthcare insurance providers, a Power BI dashboard is designed and implemented.
